# inversions_py
Inversions Algorithm using the Merge Sort subroutine with Python

This algorithm takes an array of integers, either sorted or unsorted, and count the number of inversions. 
To use it, just overwrite the file **array.txt** with your own array, each element in one line, for example:
  
    array.txt:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    
Then type **python inversions.py** in your terminal. The output is the number of inversions from the array you provided.
The file **array.txt** is already provided with an 100,000 length array of unsorted integers from 1 (included) to 100,000 (included) for testing.

Have fun!
